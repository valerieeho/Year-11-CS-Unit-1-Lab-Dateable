# Year-11-CS-Unit-1-Lab-Dateable

There is a folk rule stating you should only date someone who is at least seven years older than half your age. 
For example, an 18-year-old needs to date somebody at least 16 years old ( 7 + ( 18 / 2 ) ).

Produce a program that stores your age as an integer in a variable named age. 
The program then computes and displays the age of the youngest person for whom dating meets the folk rule.

A sample program run could be :

Prompt + input: 
Enter your age: 19

Output: 
19-year olds should date somebody who is at least 16 years old.

Another sample program run could be:

Prompt + input:  : 
Enter your age: 22

22-year olds should date somebody who is at least 18 years old.
